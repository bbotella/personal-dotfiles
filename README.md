### Using GNU Stow

> [GNU Stow][1] is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct sets of software and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem, and makes them all appear to be installed in a single directory tree.

### OhMyZsh

[OhMyZsh][2] configured using [Antidote][3] and [powerlevel10k][4] 


### Homebrew
[Homebrew][5] formulas and casks installed and backed up in a bundle: `Brewfile`

- `brew bundle install` to install all the formulas and casks
- `brew bundle dump -f` to regenerate the `Brewfile`
